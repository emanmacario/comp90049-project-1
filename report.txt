APPROXIMATE STRING SEARCH ALGORITHMS
Levenshtein distance (m,i,d,r) = (0,1,1,1)
N-grams (python or c wrapper again)

DATA PROCESSING
In 'misspell.txt', there are 10,322 words. However, there are only 3,755 unique misspelled words.
Duplicates misspelled words are filtered to avoid redundant calculations in order to reduce run-time of code.
In 'dict.txt', there are 370,099 unique words
In 'correct.txt', there are also 10,322 words. However, there are only 3,516 unique corrected words.

INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS OF DATA
1,778 of the 10,322 words in 'correct.txt' are not even in the dictionary
Out of the 3,516 unique 'correct.txt' words, 1,191 are not in the dictionary (~33.8%)


METHOD
PART 1
    1. For every unique misspelled word, get best match(es), stored in a results dictionary
        (a) If there is more than one match, break ties with
    2. For every unique (misspelled, correct) pair, evaluate whether 'correct' is in 'match(es)'
    3. Evaluate precision and recall

PART 2
    1. Remove pairs of (misspelled, correct) words where correct is not even in 'dict.txt'
    2. Repeat PART 1


IMPLEMENTATION
Code written in python
Compiled C code function Levenshtein distance is imported for run-time efficiency
Then break ties via n-grams

EVALUATION METHODS
Precision = number of correct results returned / total number of results returned = (1+1)/(10+2) = 2/12
Recall    = number of correct results returned / total number of possible correct results = (1+1)/(1+1) = 2/2
          NB: Recall uses only words in 'correct.txt' for words in the denominator

Hi Jeremy,
According to my understanding, for a token in 'misspell.txt' to be successfully changed to the corresponding token in
'correct.txt', by checking 'dictionary.txt', there are some conditions:
1. The canonical form has to also appear in 'dict.txt'(for example, 'opolo' , "can't", '9am' do not appear in 'dict.txt',
   it is impossible to return these correct words);
2. if misspelled token is not the same as the correct token, the misspell token itself cannot appear in 'dict.txt'
   (for example, misspelled token 'u' with canonical form 'you' cannot be corrected, as 'u' appears in 'dict.txt'.
   No matter what approx. string match algorithm learnt are used, we will end up with wrongly returning 'u' as canonical form)

Now if we ignore all tokens that cannot be corrected (as discussed above), and all tokens that are already in their
canonical form (for example, 'rt' in 'misspell.txt' has its canonical form 'rt', which can also be found in 'dict.txt'),
I found that there are only around 3% of tokens in 'misspell.txt' that need to be and can possibly be corrected.

Is the projected made in this way intentionally? Or I misunderstand something?
